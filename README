Build instructions:

basic build:
    $ cmake path/to/source
    $ make

Tests can be run with:
    $ make check

Default build type is release. To enable debugging
    $ cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Different tests can be selected. Options are SMLL_


Currently supported options:
  COMPUTE_ON_CPU
  COMPUTE_ON_GPU
  MILKYWAY_GPU
  DOUBLE_PRECISION
  USE_OCL

Currently only tested using COMPUTE_ON_CPU and DOUBLE_PRECISION.
Enable an option with
    $ cmake path/to/source -DOPTION_NAME=Value


Notes:

On OS X, Apple's gcc is required since macports gcc seems to not work
when you try linking against frameworks. Note you need to delete
CMakeCache.txt when you change compilers. I'm trying to take care of
this automatically but it only sort of works. Specify the Apple gcc
with -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc, for it's usual location.
